# ğŸš¨ Don't change the code above ğŸ‘†
# Write your code below this line ğŸ‘‡
# create a program that turns your years of life into weeks
# presume they live till 90

# create variable for year (age has to be wrapped in int)
years = 90 - int(age)
# calculate the week variable by using years - int (52)
weeks = years * 52
# print out using f string
print(f"You have {weeks} weeks left.")

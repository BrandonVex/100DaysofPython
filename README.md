<h2><strong>100 Days of Python</strong></h2>

<p>Welcome to my <strong>100 Days of Python</strong> project! This repository documents my journey through 100 days of learning and practicing Python programming. The project is divided into multiple phases, each with its own set of activities and major projects.</p>

<h3><strong>Project Structure</strong></h3>

<p>The project is organized into the following phases:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Day 1-14: Beginner</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Basic Python syntax and concepts</li>
      <li>Simple programs and exercises</li>
      <li><strong>Completed Projects:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
              <strong>Silent Auction Project:</strong> Built an auction system allowing users to place bids silently. Features include setting minimum bids and determining the highest bidder at the end, showcasing skills in user input handling, conditionals, and tracking bids.
          </li>
          <li>
              <strong>Treasure Hunt Project:</strong> Developed a text-based game where players search for hidden treasure using directional clues. This project emphasized control flow through loops and conditional logic to manage player movement and hints.
          </li>
          <li>
              <strong>Hangman Project:</strong> Created the classic Hangman game, allowing players to guess letters in a word. The project included random word selection, input validation, and a visual representation of incorrect guesses, highlighting skills in lists, loops, and conditional checks.
          </li>
          <li>
              <strong>Caesar Cipher Project:</strong> Built an encryption and decryption tool using the Caesar Cipher, a classic cipher that shifts letters by a set amount. This project introduced basic encryption concepts, string manipulation, and user input processing.
          </li>
          <li>
              <strong>Calculator Project:</strong> Developed a command-line calculator that performs basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Emphasis was placed on function-based programming, handling mathematical operations, and managing user inputs.
          </li>
          <li>
              <strong>Higher or Lower Project:</strong> Created a game where players guess which of two items has a higher value, such as followers. This project involved random data generation, input comparison, and logical operations to determine correct answers.
          </li>
          <li>
              <strong>Reeborg's World:</strong> Completed challenges in Reeborg's World, an online platform for practicing coding logic by guiding a robot through mazes. This project reinforced skills in loop structures, conditionals, and algorithmic thinking.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Day 15-31: Intermediate</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>More complex programs</li>
      <li>Introduction to data structures and algorithms</li>
      <li>Introduction into OOP programming</li>
      <li><strong>Completed Projects:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
              <strong>Blackjack Project:</strong> Developed a command-line Blackjack game where users play against a dealer. This project includes card shuffling, scoring, and control flow logic to manage game progression and user interactions.
          </li>
          <li>
              <strong>Coffee Machine Project:</strong> Simulated a coffee machine with options to brew various coffee types, manage resources (water, coffee, milk), and handle transactions. This project reinforced the use of functions, loops, and dictionaries for structured resource management.
          </li>
          <li>
              <strong>Turtle Race Project:</strong> Created a race simulation using Python's Turtle graphics library, allowing users to bet on turtles. This project introduced object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts with classes to manage race participants and randomized movements.
          </li>
          <li>
              <strong>Snake Project:</strong> Implemented the classic Snake game using OOP. The snake grows as it eats food, with collision detection and score tracking. Classes were structured for the snake, food, and game logic, reinforcing multi-file project organization and class interactions.
          </li>
          <li>
              <strong>Pong Project:</strong> Created a two-player Pong game using OOP principles, where players control paddles to bounce a ball. This project involved scoring, ball speed adjustments, and game loop management, enhancing understanding of inter-class communication.
          </li>
          <li>
              <strong>Crossy Road Project:</strong> Built a simplified Crossy Road game using the Turtle graphics library, reinforcing OOP concepts and handling game progression, collisions, and character movement.
          </li>
          <li>
              <strong>Mail Merger Project:</strong> Automated the creation of personalized letters using a Python script that reads names from a file and generates customized letters by replacing placeholders in a template. This project focused on file handling, string replacement, and directory management to save output files.
          </li>
          <li>
              <strong>U.S. State Guessing Game:</strong> Used Pandas to work with massive amounts of data from various CSV files to create a US State Guessing Game. 
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Day 32-58: Intermediate+</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Advanced data structures</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Day 59-81: Advanced</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Complex projects</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Day 82-100: Professional</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Professional-level projects</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3><strong>Current Focus</strong></h3>

<p>I am currently in the Intermediate+ phase, learning Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python. This involves understanding classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism to create more structured and reusable code.</p>

<h3><strong>Future Plans</strong></h3>

<p>As I progress through the remaining days, I plan to take on more complex and professional-level projects, focusing on areas such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Web development with Python frameworks</li>
  <li>Data analysis and visualization</li>
  <li>Machine learning and artificial intelligence</li>
  <li>System automation and scripting</li>
  <li>Backend Websibe Creations</li>
  <li>Python with Lambda AWS</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>How to Use This Repository</strong></h3>

<p>Each day's work is documented in its respective folder, organized by day number. Feel free to browse through the code, run the scripts, and see the progress I've made.</p>

100 Days of Python
Welcome to my 100 Days of Python project! This repository documents my journey through 100 days of learning and practicing Python programming. The project is divided into multiple phases, each with its own set of activities and major projects.

Project Structure
The project is organized into the following phases:

Day 1-14: Beginner

Basic Python syntax and concepts
Simple programs and exercises
Completed Projects:
Silent Auction Project: An auction system where users can place bids silently.
Treasure Hunt Project: A game where users search for hidden treasure based on clues.
Day 15-31: Intermediate

More complex programs
Introduction to data structures and algorithms
Completed Projects:
Blackjack Project: A command-line game simulating the classic card game.
Coffee Machine Project: A simulation of a coffee machine with functionalities to select and brew different types of coffee.
Day 32-58: Intermediate+

Advanced data structures
Deeper understanding of Python libraries and modules
Day 59-81: Advanced

Complex projects
Advanced algorithms and problem-solving techniques
Day 82-100: Professional

Professional-level projects
Best practices and optimization
Current Focus
I am currently in the Intermediate+ phase, learning Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python. This involves understanding classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism to create more structured and reusable code.

Future Plans
As I progress through the remaining days, I plan to take on more complex and professional-level projects, focusing on areas such as:

Web development with Python frameworks
Data analysis and visualization
Machine learning and artificial intelligence
System automation and scripting
How to Use This Repository
Each day's work is documented in its respective folder, organized by day number. Feel free to browse through the code, run the scripts, and see the progress I've made.

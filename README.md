<h2><strong>100 Days of Python</strong></h2>

<p>Welcome to my <strong>100 Days of Python</strong> project! This repository documents my journey through 100 days of learning and practicing Python programming. The project is divided into multiple phases, each with its own set of activities and major projects.</p>

<h3><strong>Project Structure</strong></h3>

<p>The project is organized into the following phases:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Day 1-14: Beginner</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Basic Python syntax and concepts</li>
      <li>Simple programs and exercises</li>
      <li><strong>Completed Projects:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Silent Auction Project: Developed an auction system where users can place bids silently, with features for setting minimum bids and displaying the highest bidder at the end.</li>
          <li>Treasure Hunt Project: Created a text-based game where users search for hidden treasure based on directional clues, integrating loops and conditional logic to guide the player through the game.</li>
          <li>Hangman Project: Implemented the classic Hangman game, where players guess letters to complete a word, incorporating random word selection, input validation, and tracking of incorrect guesses using a visual hangman.</li>
          <li>Caeser Cipher Project: Built an encryption and decryption tool using the Caesar Cipher method, which shifts letters in a message by a fixed number of positions, allowing users to secure their messages with simple text-based encryption.</li> 
          <li>Calculator Project: Developed a basic command-line calculator that can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, emphasizing function-based programming and user input handling.</li>
          <li>Higher Or Lower Project: Created a comparison game where players must guess which of two items (e.g., celebrities) has a higher value (e.g., followers), utilizing random data and input comparison to determine the correct answer.</li>
          <li>Reeborg's World: Solved various challenges in Reeborg's World, a Python-based online platform for learning coding logic and loops by programming a robot to navigate mazes.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Day 15-31: Intermediate</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>More complex programs</li>
      <li>Introduction to data structures and algorithms</li>
      <li>Introduction into OOP programming</li>
      <li><strong>Completed Projects:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Blackjack Project: Built a command-line version of the Blackjack card game, where users can play against a dealer, implementing card shuffling, scoring, and conditional logic to manage the flow of the game.</li>
          <li>Coffee Machine Project: Simulated a coffee machine with functionalities for selecting and brewing different types of coffee, managing resources (water, coffee, milk), and handling transactions, reinforcing the use of functions, loops, and dictionaries.</li>
          <li>Turtle Race Project: Developed a race simulation using the Turtle graphics library in Python, where users can bet on turtles, and the race outcome is determined by random movement, introducing object-oriented programming concepts.</li>
          <li>Snake Project: Implemented the classic Snake game using OOP principles, where the snake grows longer as it eats food, with collision detection and score tracking, spread across multiple files with classes for the snake, food, and game logic.</li>
          <li>Pong Project: Created a two-player Pong game using OOP in Python, where players control paddles to bounce a ball back and forth, with scoring and ball speed adjustments, emphasizing game loop management and class interaction.</li>
          <l1>Crossy Road Project: Created a basic crossy road game using the Turtle graphics library in python. This reinforced OOP programming learning experiences.
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Day 32-58: Intermediate+</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Advanced data structures</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Day 59-81: Advanced</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Complex projects</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Day 82-100: Professional</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Professional-level projects</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3><strong>Current Focus</strong></h3>

<p>I am currently in the Intermediate+ phase, learning Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python. This involves understanding classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism to create more structured and reusable code.</p>

<h3><strong>Future Plans</strong></h3>

<p>As I progress through the remaining days, I plan to take on more complex and professional-level projects, focusing on areas such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Web development with Python frameworks</li>
  <li>Data analysis and visualization</li>
  <li>Machine learning and artificial intelligence</li>
  <li>System automation and scripting</li>
  <li>Backend Websibe Creations</li>
  <li>Python with Lambda AWS</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>How to Use This Repository</strong></h3>

<p>Each day's work is documented in its respective folder, organized by day number. Feel free to browse through the code, run the scripts, and see the progress I've made.</p>

# 1st input: enter height in meters e.g: 1.65
height = input()
# 2nd input: enter weight in kilograms e.g: 72
weight = input()
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

# Write your code below this line
# change weight into an int
weight_kg = int(weight)
# change height into a float as there is a decinmal

# weight divided by height squared
# to round use the round() command at the beginning
# make the calculation into a variable for easier use
bmi = (round(weight_kg / height_m ** 2))
# print the variable
